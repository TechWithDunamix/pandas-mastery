### Module 6: Removing Duplicates and Unwanted Data

Data quality is essential for accurate analysis, and duplicates can lead to misleading results. In this module, we’ll cover how to identify and remove duplicate records in a DataFrame using Pandas. Understanding these techniques will help ensure that your analyses are based on unique, reliable data.

#### 1. **Identifying Duplicates**

##### 1.1. **Understanding Duplicates**
Duplicates occur when multiple rows contain the same data. For instance, in a customer database, having multiple entries for the same customer can distort metrics like total sales or average age.

##### 1.2. **Using `duplicated()`**
The `duplicated()` method in Pandas helps you identify duplicate rows. By default, it marks all duplicates except for the first occurrence as `True`, while unique rows are marked as `False`.

**Example:**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame with duplicates
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Alice', 'Charlie', 'Bob'],
    'Age': [24, 27, 24, 22, 27],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'New York', 'Chicago', 'Los Angeles']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Identifying duplicates
duplicates = df.duplicated()
print("Identified Duplicates (True indicates a duplicate):")
print(duplicates)
```

**Output:**
```
0    False
1    False
2     True
3    False
4     True
dtype: bool
```

In this example, the output shows that the third and fifth rows are duplicates of the first and second rows, respectively.

##### 1.3. **Identifying Duplicates Based on Specific Columns**
You can also check for duplicates based on specific columns by passing a subset of column names to the `duplicated()` method.

**Example:**
```python
# Identifying duplicates based only on 'Name'
duplicates_by_name = df.duplicated(subset=['Name'])
print("Identified Duplicates by Name:")
print(duplicates_by_name)
```

**Output:**
```
0    False
1    False
2     True
3    False
4     True
dtype: bool
```

Here, the method shows duplicates based only on the 'Name' column.

#### 2. **Removing Duplicates**

##### 2.1. **Using `drop_duplicates()`**
Once you've identified duplicates, the next step is to remove them. The `drop_duplicates()` method is used for this purpose. By default, it keeps the first occurrence of each duplicate and removes the rest.

**Example:**
```python
# Removing duplicates
cleaned_df = df.drop_duplicates()
print("DataFrame after Removing Duplicates:")
print(cleaned_df)
```

**Output:**
```
      Name  Age         City
0    Alice   24     New York
1      Bob   27  Los Angeles
3  Charlie   22       Chicago
```

In this output, you can see that the duplicates have been removed, leaving only unique rows.

##### 2.2. **Keeping Last Occurrence**
If you want to keep the last occurrence of each duplicate instead of the first, you can use the `keep` parameter.

**Example:**
```python
# Keeping the last occurrence of duplicates
cleaned_df_last = df.drop_duplicates(keep='last')
print("DataFrame after Removing Duplicates (Keeping Last):")
print(cleaned_df_last)
```

**Output:**
```
      Name  Age         City
1      Bob   27  Los Angeles
2    Alice   24     New York
3  Charlie   22       Chicago
```

In this example, the last occurrence of each duplicate has been retained.

##### 2.3. **Removing Duplicates Based on Specific Columns**
You can also specify which columns to consider when checking for duplicates. This allows for more granular control over the removal process.

**Example:**
```python
# Removing duplicates based only on 'Name'
cleaned_df_name = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['Name'])
print("DataFrame after Removing Duplicates by Name:")
print(cleaned_df_name)
```

**Output:**
```
      Name  Age         City
0    Alice   24     New York
1      Bob   27  Los Angeles
3  Charlie   22       Chicago
```

This output shows that duplicates were removed based solely on the 'Name' column, retaining only the first occurrence of each name.

### Conclusion

In this module, you've learned how to identify and remove duplicates in your DataFrame using Pandas. The `duplicated()` method allows you to detect duplicate entries, while `drop_duplicates()` helps you remove them. Understanding how to work with duplicates is crucial for maintaining data integrity, as they can significantly impact your analyses and conclusions.

By mastering these techniques, you’ll be better equipped to ensure that your data is clean, unique, and ready for insightful analysis in the upcoming modules.
